Outcome: Student can use publicly available documentation to implement an unfamiliar feature of an API.


Every MovieClip has a property called "graphics". The "graphics" property's data type is the Graphics class. Look up the Graphics class in the AS3 API. Use the documentation to help you write code in the Game class's constructor to recreate RESULTS.swf:

1. Change the existing code to draw BLACK circles instead of RED circles.

2. Change the existing code to give each of the four circles a radius of 5. Do NOT change the positions of the circles.

3. Use the Graphics class to draw two black lines and one red circle to match the RESULTS.swf
